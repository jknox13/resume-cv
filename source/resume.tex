%     SUMMARY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary}
I am a Software Engineer working on building infrastructure \& tools for language models.
Previously I worked as a Data Scientist in both research \& in industry.
Throughout my diverse work experience, I have identified,
communicated, and solved problems in close collaboration with
cross-functional partners.
